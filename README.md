# adult-icu_utilization
Repo to host Github page for animated choropleth for Adult ICU Utilization for selected states from March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2022.  Completed as part of final project for DSCI521.

See animation here: https://marymlucas.github.io/adult-icu_utilization/

You may want to advance the slider to July 2020 as that is when ICU utilization begins to really ramp up.
