# Adult ICU Utilization during COVID-19 Pandemic - Animated Choropleth 
Repo to host Github page for animated choropleth of Adult ICU Utilization for selected states from March 1, 2020 to March 1, 2022.  Created using Plotly, as part of EDA for final class project DSCI521.

You may want to advance the slider to July 2020 as that is when ICU utilization begins to really ramp up.
